## Key Concepts Learned

1. **Component-Based Design**
   - Breaking down the UI into reusable components like `Header`, `Footer`, and `Note`.

2. **State Management**
   - Managing dynamic data (e.g., input values and notes) using `useState`.

3. **Event Handling**
   - Capturing user interactions like button clicks and input changes using React event listeners.

4. **Dynamic Rendering**
   - Rendering dynamic lists with `.map()` and conditionally rendering elements.

5. **Material-UI Integration**
   - Using Material-UI components for faster, modern UI design.

6. **Styling Techniques**
   - Combining inline styles with external CSS for responsive and consistent design.
